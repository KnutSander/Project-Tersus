## The Problem:
Tasked with creating a new solution to hand sanitization, the team must tackle the problem of exactly how the current system can be improved; the current system is very primitive and requires manual labour to carry out – it also fails to address the issues of how the behaviour of those cleaning their hands could be improved.

## The Opportunity Presented:
This opportunity to improve an antiquated system allows the team to create something unique, that can actively improve health and make big changes. As the current system requires the manual collection of data, the costs of doing so can be dramatically decreased if this action is performed automatically; a change that is growing increasingly important as the economy reacts to the foundation shifting caused by the current pandemic. By the same token, it has become increasingly clear that the technique of hand washing is just as important as the act itself. [1] The current system doesn’t truly allow for improvement to manifest; having someone watching over you as you clean your hands is bound to lead to frustrations and concerns over personal privacy. The system that we propose will tackle these issues head-on.

## The Goal:
Our goal is to create a sanitation station that actively works to improve the hygiene of those using it. Basic details of the user will be collected as they use the sanitizer, as well the details of how they use it. This information will then be relayed to them in a safe and private manner, allowing for them to seek improvement themselves. While the system can be used to reprimand those that sanitize poorly, history and science have proven that encouraging good behaviour is more effective than punishing bad behaviour (studies have shown that punishments are most effective at instead lessening less desirable behaviour [2]). Technology in the past has managed to achieve this by “gamifying” the activity [3], and this is very much where our efforts will lie. To further improve the effectiveness of the technology – the aim is to use the information gathered and process it in such a way as to be able to predict sickness in users and provide useful statistics in the spread of disease and germs.

## Similar Technologies:
Other technologies do exist that attempt to achieve a similar goal (such as Soapy by SoapyCare [4] and Germ Destroyer – a German university project that took gamification to much more literal level [5]), however these solutions are expensive and take a large amount of space that companies are unlikely to invest in – our approach is to make the sanitizer with off-the-shelf components and currently existing technology, resulting in a much more affordable solution that is able to analyse the data fed into it. 

## Benefit to Users:
As stated before, the Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted several key issues with the way things are currently done, and attention to personal hygiene has proven to be the issue that has had the most light shone upon it: thus the benefits of a system that aims to improve fundamental behavioural patterns is obvious. As the system is designed to improve the behaviour and not just the sole act, users are expected to carry their improved hand-washing technique into all aspects of life – not just that of the workplace. This also benefits the companies that could use the system: as poor hygiene leads to poor health, a system that is utilised to improve this would result in a company that not only pays less for the system than the manual alternative, but also in a company that is now paying less towards employees taking sick-leave.

## Technologies Being Used:
The team are planning on using the current casing for the hand sanitizer, modified only slightly to allow for a Raspberry Pi minicomputer to fit inside. This will be the brains of the operation and connected to an RFID reader that will be able to detect the user that is requesting the sanitizer. This device will then be able to store the details of the user in a safe database that can only be accessed by those with the correct privileges. This will allow for administrators to assess the data and how both individual users and teams/departments are using the system. This database can then be used in conjunction with a phone or web-based app, that will inform the user as to their performance. Due to the familiarity of the technology being used, this system can also have modifications or improvements made to it based on the demands of the company; for example, employing the use of a screen or the detection of sanitizer left in the dispenser. 

## Preparation for the Project:
Some members of the team have had experience with Raspbery Pi in the past, and everyone has used the requisite Python language on other projects before; one member has even had specific experience in the manipulation of hardware via Python. Due to the extensive documentation available for the hardware planned on being used, the team is confident that the necessary components are in place to begin work on the project.
