# Main Ideas  
- Successfully collect/log the data ( time, date, department/ward) from all hand sanitisers and taps using RFID readers/scanners, wirelessly(individually and also part of an integrated system)
- Admin/manager should access effortlessly this data in real-time through a web interface.
- Produce accurate measurements/reports and improve behaviour regarding hand-hygiene (presenting risk factors/rate)

# Functional Requirements #
- Every user has to be uniquely identifiable
- The web server must be able to receive data from the hand sanitizer
- Information must be accessible through a web interface
- The web server must compute a risk-based assessment based on the data  
- The web server must handle multiple sources of data simultaneously  
- RFID information should be encrypted
- The system must attempt to improve hand sanitzing behaviour of users

# Non-functional Requirements #
- The information displayed should be easy to understand and visually pleasing
- Data can be compared across teams/locations
- Data can be categorized
- The system must fit inside a hand sanitizer
