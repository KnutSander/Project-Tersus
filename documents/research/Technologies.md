# Technology Research
## Radio-frequency Identification (RFID)
One research paper shows that hand dispensers with a time-based microcontroller has been attempted but there was no collection of the ID of the user and the whereabouts of said user. To combat this, they used wearable monitors. Has a really nice embedded systems diagram and a logic flowchart.[^1]

## Ultraviolet Light (UV)
UV can be used as markers within the hand-gel or soap to detect how well a user has distributed the cleaning method over their hands. A camera was used to detect the %coverage. We could use this for gamification? More coverage = more points [^2]

## Infrared Sensors (IR)
We can set up an IR field to monitor zones around a patient bed or a hygiene station, like Xbox Kinect. [^3] We can use this to detect how long the user is in the area? [^4] 

## Near-field Communication (NFC)
We can use NFC built into almost any modern phone for unique ID, can be used for a check in to a hand hygiene station.

## Real Time Locations System (RLTS)
We can recommend the user of a RLTS that uses beacons to track specific locations of users. Similar to the IR tech but this one has ID built in. [^5]

## Machine Learning
This last research paper is most like what we want to do. They used data gathered from users and patients (dispenser trackers, IR "tripwires", pressure plates, etc.) and applied machine learning to create a model to notify users. [^6] This one looks like the best one to do/implement. It has a fairly good cost/effectiveness ration.
